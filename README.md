## 1. Distance Between Magnetic Barycenters Varying due to Earth's Atmospheric Turbulence

### 1.1 Gif 1: Static PSF  
**Description:** The same PSF is used to aberrate all the polarization images that are combined to construct the Stokes parameters for the inversion process.

### 1.2 Gif 2: Dynamic PSF  
**Description:** Different PSFs are applied to aberrate each polarization image individually before combining them into the Stokes parameters for the inversion process.
